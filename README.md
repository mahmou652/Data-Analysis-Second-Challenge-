# Advanced Data Analysis Challenge 2: XYZ Corp. Operational Intelligence Dashboard

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project addresses the **Advanced Data Analysis - Challenge 2**, focusing on XYZ Corp., a company managing thousands of employees across numerous projects in different countries. In 2024, the executive management observed alarming indicators: high employee attrition rates in some locations, imbalanced team workloads, escalating operational costs without clear explanations, and difficulties in predicting HR efficiency for new projects.

This project involved developing an **intelligent automation system** using Power BI to analyze raw data, identify root causes of these issues, design "What-if" scenarios, and propose actionable solutions for 2025 to enhance operational decision-making.

## üéØ Key Objectives & Problems Addressed

*   **Understand the complete operational picture:** Starting from scattered raw data (employee files, project details, daily tasks, attendance records).
*   **Data processing and linking:** To create a cohesive dataset for analysis.
*   **Root Cause Analysis for:**
    *   High employee attrition.
    *   Variations in productivity across locations.
    *   Task distribution and potential scheduling flaws.
*   **Design "What-if" Scenarios to explore impacts of:**
    *   Employee rotation between projects.
    *   Changes in working hours.
    *   Efficiency-based task distribution (addressed through recommendations).
*   **Create an Intelligent Automation System:** A dynamic Power BI dashboard that updates with new data to support real-time decision-making.
*   **Propose Practical Solutions for 2025:** An operational plan based on data and realistic analysis, explaining how to optimize resource distribution and reduce waste.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used

*   **SQL:** For initial data processing and querying.
*   **Microsoft Excel:** For data preparation and supplementary analysis.
*   **Microsoft Power BI:** For data modeling, creating complex DAX measures, designing interactive dashboards, and developing "What-if" scenario analyses.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Analyses

*   **Comprehensive Interactive Dashboard:** Featuring an overview, detailed workload analysis (project, employee/department), performance analysis (project, productivity), attrition analysis, and actionable recommendations.
*   **Advanced "What-If" Scenarios:** Dynamically modeling the potential impacts of:
    *   Strategies to reduce new hire and Field Service attrition.
    *   Initiatives to retain mid-level talent (2-3 years experience).
    *   Impact of salary adjustments on overall attrition.
    *   Effects of employee rotation and working hours adjustments on productivity and costs.
*   **In-depth Attrition Analysis:** Identifying key drivers and patterns of employee turnover, leading to targeted retention strategies.
*   **Workload Balancing Insights:** Pinpointing overloaded and underutilized projects, departments, and employees.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Tracking project completion rates, productivity trends, and identifying inefficiencies.
*   **Actionable Recommendations for 2025:** Strategic proposals for workload management, performance enhancement, attrition reduction, and operational process optimization.
